# chess online
An online chess game that allows players to create or join games could work as follows:

1-  The player creates 'a fake account' on the chess game and logs in.

2-  The player has the option to either create a new game or join an existing game. If the player chooses to create a new game, they just wait for another player to join in. 

3-  If the player chooses to join an existing game, they can browse a list of available games and select one to join.

4-  Once the player has created or joined a game, they can play against their opponent in real-time or turn-based mode. The players can communicate with each other through a chat function.
